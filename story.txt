George Costa is an ultra-runner. This means that he runs races that are over 26 miles long. George is very fit and one day hopes to run the Barkley Marathons, a very difficult and long race. Only 15 people have ever completed the Barkley Marathons in the history of the race. George is confident he can complete the race because of the extensive training he has put in. This year he has competed in 15 100 mile races. He is in the best shape of his life. 

George is planning for an upcoming marathon to run in honor of his late brother. He will be running a staggering 200 miles over the course of the race. Even though he is in his prime it will be a test of his will.

George knew he was a competent runner but he had never run over 150 miles, so he began to worry that he might not be able to do the full 200 unless he ran at least 180 first to be safe. It's what his brother would have wanted. George began running from Madison to Milwaukee and back every day for lunch as a way to train. He then set his eyes on running all the way from Madison to Eau Claire.

George then realized he was being filmed for a movie.  This movie became Forrest Gump and he was paid mightily for his role in the running scene and began to run further across the country and recieve a large following.  He was one of the greatest runners to ever live.



George believed he had honored his brother and he was happy. George finally stopped running when he was 80 years old. The day he stopped was the happiest day of his life. He was so filled with satisfaction adn joy, he laid down and passed away. His family had a funeral for him and talked about George and his brother and what George was able to accomplish.

The End.
